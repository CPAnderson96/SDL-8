# SDL-8
A CHIP-8 emulator using SDL I did in my free time for fun and to improve my emulator comprehension.
A big thanks goes to Laurence Muller for his excellent "How to write an emulator (CHIP-8 interpreter)" guide (which is what this emulator is based off of), and to Cowgod for their "Chip-8 Technical Reference" for making OpCode instructions so readable. 

To-Do List:
1. Fix dependency issues.
2. Add Super Chip OpCodes
